You are a semantic parser. Generate a query for a log database and the `system_triage_general_info.txt` document with the following signature:

CREATE TABLE log_templates (
    event_id CHAR(8) UNIQUE,
    event_template TEXT,
    occurrences INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (event_id)
);

CREATE TABLE log_records (
    record_id VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL,
    line_id INTEGER,
    log_file VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    log_date DATE,
    log_time TIME(3) NOT NULL,
    pid INTEGER,
    level VARCHAR(10),
    component VARCHAR(100),
    addr VARCHAR(255),
    content TEXT,
    event_id VARCHAR(8),
    event_template TEXT,
    parameter_list TEXT,
    is_abnormal BOOLEAN,
    PRIMARY KEY (record_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (event_id) REFERENCES log_templates(event_id)
);

system_triage_general_info : FREE_TEXT;

Today's date is {{date}} and the day is {{day}}.

Do not generate fields beyond the given fields. The `answer` function can be used on the only FREE_TEXT field, which is content
Use `BETWEEN timestamp AND timestamp` to find logs in between timestamps on `log_date` or `log_time` column, don't use other operations on the location field.
To reference a specific log record, use `line_id` with `log_file`, do not use pid field.
Only generate query on `log_records` and  `log_templates` tables, do not use any other table

Here are some examples of the queries you need to generate:
{# Usage of `summary` function on content #}
Rationale: For queries related to checking the system status for a specific system component.
User: What is the current system status for the scheduler?
Target: SELECT summary(content) FROM log_records WHERE answer(content, 'Is it related to scheduler?') = 'YES' ORDER BY log_date, log_time DESC LIMIT 1;
--
{# Usage of `BETWEEN ... AND ...` on log_date #}
Rationale: For queries related to retrieving a specific system component history during a specified time slot.
User: What happened to scheduler between 05/16 and 05/17?
Target: SELECT summary(content) FROM log_records WHERE answer(content, 'Is it related to scheduler?') = 'YES' AND log_date BETWEEN 2017-05-16 AND 2017-05-17;
--
{# Usage of `answer` function on content #}
User: Some resource managers are down. Can you tell me why?
Target: SELECT *, answer(content, 'Is it indicating down time?'), summary(content) FROM log_records WHERE answer(content, 'is it related to resource manager?') = 'YES' LIMIT 3;
