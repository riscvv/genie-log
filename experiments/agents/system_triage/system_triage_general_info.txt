# System Triage Guidelines
System triage refers to the process of quickly assessing and prioritizing issues within
a system—whether it's a computer system, network, application, or infrastructure—so that the most critical problems are addressed first.
This is often done in the context of troubleshooting, incident response, or IT support.

The goal of system triage is to identify and mitigate problems as efficiently as possible, preventing further damage,
and minimizing downtime or service disruption. It can be applied in a variety of environments,
from servers to cloud systems to end-user devices.

## Gather Information
Before jumping into fixing issues, collect as much information as possible about the system and the problem. This involves:

System Logs: Review application, security, and system logs for errors or unusual activity.
User Reports: Collect information from users or stakeholders regarding symptoms, timelines, and the scope of the issue.
Monitoring Data: Look at monitoring dashboards or metrics to identify any spikes, drops, or trends in performance, CPU, memory usage, disk space, etc.
Recent Changes: Identify recent system or software changes (deployments, configuration changes, patches, etc.) that could have introduced the problem.

## Identify Potential Root Causes
Try to narrow down the possible causes of the problem:

Hardware failure: Disk, memory, CPU, or other physical component failures.
Software bugs: Issues in application code, databases, or operating system software.
Configuration issues: Misconfigurations in network, security, or system settings.
Network or connectivity issues: Bandwidth, latency, or routing problems.
External factors: Power outages, third-party service failures, or security threats like DDoS attacks.
